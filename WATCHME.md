## What’s in the video

- We go through ** 25 classes** (24 lowercase Greek letters + “no letter”)  
- Show how the model responds to correct and incorrect inputs  
- Point out common mistakes and surprising high-confidence successes  
- Discuss how lighting, background, and font affect performance  

## Key Observations

- Some letters that look similar (like ν vs. v, ο vs. o) are sometimes confused  
- “No letter” class helps reduce false positives from backgrounds  
- The model is strong for distinct letters like ω, ξ, ψ
